# Sample screenshot of project phase2 working setup
![alt text](../images/phase2.png)

In this phase I have added the basic principles of object oriented programming, unit testing, and design principles such as **SOLID**, **DRY**, **GRASP**, and seperation of concerns. Each functionality and classes are moved to a seperate file for a better, modular and clean code and functionality management.

## Added features to project as part of this phase:
1. Static methods on the Calculator.
2. Instance methods on the Calculation.
- Having a calculation history to store calculation instances.
3. Class methods on the Calculations class.
4. Having the convenience methods on the calculations class to manage the history
5. More advanced testing that uses parameterized test data.
- Also introduction of fixture to make it easy to setup each test with consistent data.
6. There are also modifciations to the .pylintrc file to control pylint's code analysis.
